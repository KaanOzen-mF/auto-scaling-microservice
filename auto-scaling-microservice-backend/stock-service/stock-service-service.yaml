# Specifies the version of the Kubernetes API to use for creating this object.
# 'v1' is the core API group for fundamental resources like Service.
apiVersion: v1

# Defines the type of Kubernetes resource to be created, which is a Service.
kind: Service

# Contains metadata that uniquely identifies the Service object.
metadata:
  # The unique name for this Service within its namespace (default).
  name: stock-service-svc
  # Labels attached to this Service object for organization and selection.
  labels:
    app: stock-service

# 'spec' (specification) describes the desired state and behavior of the Service.
spec:
  # 'type: NodePort' exposes the Service on a static port on each Node's IP.
  # This provides a way to access the service from outside the Kubernetes cluster,
  # which is useful for Minikube.
  type: NodePort

  # This selector identifies the group of Pods that this Service will target.
  # The Service will forward traffic to any Pod with a label that matches this selector.
  selector:
    # It looks for Pods with the label 'app: stock-service'.
    # This MUST exactly match the label set on the Pods in the stock-service-deployment.yaml.
    app: stock-service

  # Defines the service's port mappings.
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP # The IP protocol for this port.

      # The port on which this Service is exposed inside the cluster's network.
      port: 3001

      # The port on the target Pods/containers that traffic will be forwarded to.
      # This should match the 'containerPort' for the stock-service container.
      targetPort: 3001

      # IMPORTANT: Adding a name to the port. This is required by Prometheus's
      # ServiceMonitor to identify which port to scrape for metrics in the future.
      name: http
